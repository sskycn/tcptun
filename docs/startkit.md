# Proxy Protocol Startkit

Chinese version: [startkit.zh-CN.md](startkit.zh-CN.md)

This startkit explains the client/server tunnel protocols supported by this project. The default documentation language is English. Chinese translations use the `.zh-CN.md` suffix.

Protocol pages:

- [Native protocol](protocol-native.md)
- [VLESS protocol](protocol-vless.md)
- [VMess protocol](protocol-vmess.md)
- [Trojan protocol](protocol-trojan.md)

All examples use placeholders. Do not commit real server addresses, UUIDs, Trojan passwords, REALITY public/private keys, TLS private keys, or production config files.

## Generate Configs

Run without flags to start the interactive wizard:

```sh
bin/proxy config
```

Generate configs non-interactively:

```sh
bin/proxy config --protocol native --server-addr proxy.example.com:9443
bin/proxy config --protocol vless --server-addr proxy.example.com:9443
bin/proxy config --protocol vmess --server-addr proxy.example.com:9443
bin/proxy config --protocol trojan --server-addr proxy.example.com:443 --tls --tls-server-name proxy.example.com
```

By default, config generation writes three files:

- `server.json`: used by `proxy server`.
- `client.json`: used by `proxy client`.
- `route.json`: used by local/client routing rules and learned direct-failure targets.

Runtime config defaults:

- `proxy server` reads `server.json`.
- `proxy client` reads `client.json`.
- `proxy` and `proxy local` read `config.json`.
- Relative config paths are searched in this order: executable directory, current working directory, then `~/.config/proxy`.
- If no file exists, write-back uses the executable directory.
- `--config <path>` overrides the mode default.
- `--config ""` disables runtime config loading.
- `--route-config <path>` overrides the default `route.json` route file.
- `--route-config ""` disables route loading and write-back.

## Run

Server:

```sh
bin/proxy server
```

Client:

```sh
bin/proxy client
```

Override the config path:

```sh
bin/proxy server --config /etc/proxy/server.json
bin/proxy client --config /etc/proxy/client.json
```

## Shared Fields

| Field | Modes | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | server/client/local | Runtime mode. `server` accepts tunnel connections, `client` opens the local mixed proxy and forwards through a tunnel server, and `local` discovers a gateway proxy. |
| `listen_addr` | server/client/local | Local listen address. Servers commonly use `0.0.0.0:9443`; clients commonly use `127.0.0.1:1080`. |
| `server_addr` | client | Tunnel server address in `host:port` form. |
| `token` | server/client | Authentication material. For `native` it is a shared token, for VLESS/VMess it is a UUID, and for Trojan it is the password. |
| `tunnel_protocol` | server/client | Tunnel protocol: `native`, `vless`, `vmess`, or `trojan`. |
| `tunnel_transport` | server/client | Carrier transport: `raw`, `ws`, `h2`, or `h3`. |
| `tunnel_path` | server/client | HTTP/WebSocket path for `ws`, `h2`, and `h3`; raw transport usually ignores it. |
| `tunnel_tls` | client | Whether the client uses TLS for raw/ws/h2 transport. HTTP/3 always uses QUIC/TLS. |
| `tunnel_tls_cert` | server | Server TLS certificate path. |
| `tunnel_tls_key` | server | Server TLS private key path. |
| `tunnel_tls_server_name` | client | TLS SNI and certificate verification name. |
| `tunnel_tls_insecure` | client | Skip TLS certificate verification. Use only for tests. |
| `tunnel_security` | server/client | Extra security layer. Currently used for VLESS REALITY with value `reality`. |
| `tunnel_flow` | server/client | VLESS flow, for example `xtls-rprx-vision`. |
| `tunnel_mux` | server/client | Enables this project's tunnel multiplexing. Currently supported by `native`. |
| `gateway_ip` | local | Upstream gateway IP. Leave empty to auto-discover only when the local machine has a private IPv4 address. |
| `gateway_port` | local | Gateway proxy port. Defaults to `1080`. |
| `upstream_protocol` | client/local | Upstream protocol used for parsed proxy traffic: `socks5` or `mixed`. |
| `socks5_username` | client/local | Local SOCKS5 username. Setting username or password enables username/password auth for SOCKS5 clients. |
| `socks5_password` | client/local | Local SOCKS5 password. |
| `upstream_socks5_username` | local | Username used when dialing an upstream SOCKS5 gateway. |
| `upstream_socks5_password` | local | Password used when dialing an upstream SOCKS5 gateway. |
| `direct_probe_timeout` | client/local | Timeout used by direct-first probing before falling back upstream. Default is `500ms`; JSON accepts Go duration strings such as `"500ms"`. |
| `dial_timeout` | server/client/local | TCP dial timeout for upstream, tunnel, and gateway checks. Default is `5s`. |
| `refresh_interval` | local | Interval for checking local IPv4 changes. Gateway rediscovery only runs after local IPv4 changes. `0` disables refresh. |
| `scan_timeout` | local | Per-IP timeout when scanning the local IPv4 network for a reachable gateway proxy. |
| `scan_retry_interval` | local | Pause before retrying local IPv4 network scanning after no reachable gateway proxy is found. Default is `5s`. |
| `scan_workers` | local | Parallel workers used during local IPv4 network scanning. |
| `buffer_size` | server/client/local | Per-direction copy buffer size. Values below 4096 are raised to 4096. |
| `verbose` | server/client/local | Enables debug logs. Access logs are printed regardless of this setting. |

## Route Fields

Route fields live in `route.json`, not in `server.json`, `client.json`, or `config.json`. `proxy config` writes an empty route file by default.

When local mode auto-discovers a gateway and local IPv4 scanning finds no reachable proxy, it waits for `scan_retry_interval` and scans the same local private IPv4 networks again. This retry loop stops when at least one proxy is found, the process exits, or the discovery context is canceled. When scanning finds multiple reachable proxies, all of them are kept as upstream candidates and sorted by measured connection latency. New source IPs prefer the fastest known candidate; an existing source IP keeps using its bound upstream until that upstream fails to connect or complete the upstream protocol handshake. Gateway discovery and scanning are still only triggered when the local machine has a private IPv4 address and, after startup, when the local IPv4 address set changes.

| Field | Modes | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `force_upstream.domains` | client/local | Exact normalized domain matches. Learned direct TCP failures for hostnames are added here unless another rule already covers them. |
| `force_upstream.domain_regexes` | client/local | Go/RE2 regular expressions matched against the normalized lowercase host. |
| `force_upstream.domain_suffixes` | client/local | Matches the suffix itself and all subdomains. Values are normalized, deduplicated, and sorted during write-back. |
| `force_upstream.ips` | client/local | Exact IP matches. Learned direct TCP failures for IP targets are added here unless another rule already covers them. |
| `force_upstream.ip_cidrs` | client/local | CIDR prefix matches. |
| `force_upstream.ip_ranges` | client/local | Alias for CIDR-style ranges; parsed the same way as `ip_cidrs`. |

Before exit, learned direct TCP failures are merged into `route.json` or the configured `--route-config` file. If more than three subdomains under the same registrable domain appear in `force_upstream.domains`, that registrable domain is promoted into `force_upstream.domain_suffixes` and the covered exact-domain entries are removed.

## Direct-First Fallback

For parsed TCP proxy traffic, force-upstream route rules win first. Otherwise the proxy tries a direct TCP connection before using the upstream.

- Plain HTTP requests that normally have no request body must receive a first response byte within `direct_probe_timeout`.
- HTTP CONNECT and SOCKS5 CONNECT wait for the client's first tunnel payload, send it to the direct target, and require a first response byte within `direct_probe_timeout`.
- If probing fails, the target is marked upstream-only, the first payload is replayed to the upstream path, and later connections skip the direct attempt.
- UDP uses a conservative rule: internal UDP targets go direct, other UDP targets go upstream.

## Transport Choices

| Transport | Best fit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `raw` | Direct TCP, TLS, Trojan, REALITY | Lowest overhead. Prefer it when a plain TCP port is available. |
| `ws` | nginx HTTP reverse proxy, common CDNs | HTTP/1.1 WebSocket. The most practical option behind web infrastructure. |
| `h2` | HTTP/2 upstreams | Uses h2c without certs; uses TLS HTTP/2 when server cert/key are configured. |
| `h3` | HTTP/3/QUIC | Server requires TLS cert/key; client connects with HTTPS/QUIC. |

## Protocol Capability Matrix

| Protocol | TCP | SOCKS5 UDP relay | Tunnel mux | TLS | REALITY/Vision | Xray compatibility target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| native | yes | yes | yes | yes | no | Not applicable |
| vless | yes | no | no | yes | yes | VLESS TCP, REALITY/Vision |
| vmess | yes | no | no | yes | no | VMess AEAD TCP, security none |
| trojan | yes | no | no | recommended | no | Trojan TCP |

## Which Protocol Should I Use?

- Use `native` when both sides run this project and you want the best feature coverage.
- Use `vless` when you need VLESS or Xray REALITY/Vision compatibility.
- Use `vmess` when you need Xray VMess AEAD TCP compatibility with `security: "none"`.
- Use `trojan` when you need Trojan TCP compatibility, usually with raw TLS.
- Use `ws` transport when the server sits behind nginx or a common HTTP/CDN path.
